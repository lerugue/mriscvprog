Please use this with a RISC-V I toolchain.

This is only available from the server. If you want to compile your own 
toolchain, a good startpoint is to go to:

https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32

Then get your RISC-V I toolchain.

Commands used are on the source of every test:

test1 : Blink
test2 : Only turns on leds
test3 : Only turns off leds
